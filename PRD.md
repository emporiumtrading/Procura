# Product Requirements Document: Government Contract Opportunity Automation Platform

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2024  
**Status:** Draft  
**Classification:** Internal Use Only

---

## 1. Product Overview

The Government Contract Opportunity Automation Platform is an internal operations system designed to streamline the discovery, qualification, storage, and application process for government, state, municipal, and independent contractor opportunities. The platform automates the end-to-end workflow from opportunity ingestion through submission tracking, while maintaining strict security controls, auditability, and human oversight mechanisms.

The system integrates multiple data sources (APIs and permitted scraping), employs AI-powered normalization and qualification, maintains a secure contracts vault, and leverages OpenManus for browser-based application automation. The platform supports both semi-autonomous and fully autonomous submission workflows with configurable safety controls.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current State Challenges

- **Manual Discovery Overhead:** Staff manually monitor dozens of federal, state, municipal, and contractor portals daily, leading to missed opportunities and inconsistent coverage.
- **Inconsistent Qualification:** Human reviewers apply subjective and variable criteria when evaluating opportunities, resulting in inconsistent prioritization and resource allocation.
- **Document Management Fragmentation:** Contract documents, credentials, submissions, and audit trails are stored across multiple systems (email, file shares, spreadsheets), making retrieval and compliance reporting difficult.
- **Credential Management Risk:** Account credentials for various portals are stored insecurely (spreadsheets, shared passwords), creating security vulnerabilities and compliance risks.
- **Application Process Inefficiency:** Manual form filling and submission processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and do not scale with opportunity volume.
- **Limited Visibility:** No centralized tracking of submission status, confirmation receipts, or historical performance metrics across opportunities.

### Impact

- Reduced opportunity capture rate due to manual monitoring limitations
- Increased time-to-application, reducing competitive advantage
- Compliance and security risks from fragmented credential management
- Inability to scale operations without proportional headcount increases
- Lack of data-driven insights for improving opportunity selection and application success rates
