## Roadmap Summary

**Total Estimated Duration:** 12 months

**Phase Timeline:**
- Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Months 1-2)
- Phase 2: Opportunity Ingestion & Intelligence (Months 2-3)
- Phase 3: Contracts Vault & Document Management (Months 3-4)
- Phase 4: Account & Credential Management (Months 4-5)
- Phase 5: AI Normalization & Qualification (Months 5-7)
- Phase 6: Assisted Application Automation (Months 7-9)
- Phase 7: Autonomous Automation (Months 9-10)
- Phase 8: Hardening, Monitoring & Risk Controls (Months 10-12)

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 (infrastructure)
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 1 (storage infrastructure)
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 1 (security foundation)
- Phase 5 depends on Phase 2 (opportunity data)
- Phase 6 depends on Phases 3, 4, 5 (documents, credentials, qualification)
- Phase 7 depends on Phase 6 (assisted automation proven)
- Phase 8 can run in parallel with Phases 6-7 (hardening)

**Risk Mitigation Strategy:**
- Early phases focus on data integrity and security (foundation)
- Automation introduced only after secure storage and intelligence proven
- Human approval mandatory for all initial automation
- Autonomous mode restricted to approved portals only
- Comprehensive monitoring and kill-switches before autonomous operation
